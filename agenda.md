### "Parking lot" for future/recurring agenda items

<details>
<summary>Topics List</summary>
Meta-topics and Potential quarter-wide or year-long goals:
3. Venn diagram of interop goals, and scopes/definitions of interop (contextual)
    * Don't lose focus on the map model! [link](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/decentralized-identity.github.io/blob/master/assets/crosscommunity-architecture-survey-oct-2020.pdf)
    * Parallelize (and promote) interop work on totally different scopes
    * Proposed Work Item: **Architectural guidelines**: "if your role in the ecosystem includes X, looks at ABC specs and make sure you speak D and F to maximize interoperability (and/or future-compatibility)"
    * Incorporate/consider [ToIP TIPs](https://github.com/trustoverip/technology-stack-wg/blob/master/TIP_LIFECYCLE_MANAGEMENT.md) and [OIX interop study](https://twitter.com/pamelarosiedee/status/1339223733303570432)
1. Human-centric interop as roadmap and business strategy (+ UX?)
2. Further afield usecases (VC-free, DID-free, human-free, LEI, etc) 
    * Non-human decentralized identity?
6. Interop test suites and harness infrastructure (after March when SVIP/CCG interop sprint ends)
4. Notary models and adoption hacks? (governance?)

* VCs versus VPs - is habituating individuals to exchanging strong credentials a dark pattern per se? how to keep VPs ephermal and useless to traffic analysis?
    * Revocable anonymity? Court orders?        
    * Adrian's question: do too many VC mental models and specs *assume* VCs going straight from issuer to holder, never issuer to verifier on direct behalf of holder?
* Periodic checkins on the multi-ledger (and possible multi-method!?) Indyverse
* --- **BBS+ FIESTA 2020** --- [**proposed**]
    * December 2nd or 9th?

    * Status update on SVIP's past and future suite maintenance
    * Aries and/or BCGov test suites
    * Can someone from Danube or IBM show the smoke tests run against driver updates to the universal resolver?
    * Any volunteers have internal compliance/smoke tests they want to show? (A quick video recording would also be great if timezones are brutal!)
* Educational presentations
    * Oliver - [DAF update](https://medium.com/uport/trusted-p2p-messaging-with-dids-didcomm-and-vcs-398f4c3f3cda) ? (VC-focused edition)

<details>
<summary>Minutes</summary>

- DID-Core update from Daniel Burnett
    - self-bio - illustrious standards career (never knew the WebRTC piece!)
        - important update: Brent Zundel and Wayne Chang taking over VC maintenance group!
        - Consensys and Enterprise Ethereum Alliance!
    - 2 year charter period = standard for a recommendation-track spec
        - all other outputs are non-normative and non-rec track (usecases + reqs, implementation guide, rubric that came out of RWOT)
        - DID Resolutions spec is NOT a work item of the W3C DID-Core group - that's CCG!
            - industrial participants in the group lobbied against scope creep- resolution put out
            - not just resolution but ALL operations put out of scope of the DID spec itself (just the identifier, ma'am)
            - DID-Resolution *interface* defined in did-core, but only that
        - W3C not a fan of extensions - implementation reports (provided by implementers about the group's test suite), which are due **one month** after getting to "proposed recommendation" freeze 
            - Feb 9 - any issue without a PR gets put on ice for now
    - Problem Issues :D 
        - Informational appendices (some might be W3C notes)
        - DAG-CBOR editorial snafu and maturity issues (W3C Note might make more sense than an appendix?)
        - Let's not forget the extensions registry! It explicitly permits new representations (incl additional/future CBOR variants)
        - W3C - Objection process
        - Implementation reports - Orie is taking lead on this one
            - Open to non-members
- EEA - making Ethereum safer and easier for businesses to use
    - Public mainnet and consortium uses both in scope
    - Enterprise Ethereum (competitors to Fabric and Corda, exc with a mainnet)
        - {more devs than anybody, hehe}
        - Specs for enterprise
    - EthTrust working group - levels of security audits for smart contracts (auditing badges)
        - actual audits outsourced to security auditing firms 
    - New DeFi interest group - should be popular
    - Eth2 interest group coming soon
    - Portable ID check/eKYC for cryptocurrency onboarding - need to be more portable than conventional banks! 
- MultiProof VCs - [Presi](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14SQpmG8O1FHXk2a4iauo9aOxM_9zq9e9TEboQNJpjU0/edit#slide=id.gc6f80d1ff_0_0)
    - [LD Proofs](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-proofs/) spec (independent spec) - includes possibility of multiple proofs!
        - Proof Sets (serial) versus Proof Chains (cumulative-- includes previous signatures)
        - Troy: Our Orb method does [this](https://trustbloc.github.io/did-method-orb/#example-9-orb-transaction)! 
        - examples in the wild: Essif v1 VerifiableID (secp with did:ebsi-eth:xxx#key-1 + eidasSeal2019 with cert)
            + Xavier: we're (Essif) are updating this now: AES is our assertionmethod: XADES, PADES, or now JAdES based on JWS (CR in ETSI)
            + Markus: one thing we discussed back then in the v1 days was just signing the VC with the DID but put the Eidas Seal in the DID Doc; 
    - verificationMethod type EidasCertificate2019 was just a proposal; JAdES vM **will** however be registered with W3C
        - security-vocab and [LD-crypto registry](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-cryptosuite-registry/)
    - example #2 from USCIS PRC project
        - non-signature proofs! proof of work, hash of credential being registered on a blockchain (forgotten trend-- adds little security and adds correlation :D )
    - example #3
    - example #4 - Veres One uses some amount of POW when you register a DID... that might be another example of non-sig assertion method 
    - Troy in chat: The Orb setup is very much like certificate transparency … since we use VCs instead of X509s, we call it Verifiable Credential Transparency :). https://trustbloc.github.io/did-method-orb/#vct-v1

### Agenda - 20 Jan 2021 - US/EU time (0600 PT) - Tour of the OS Veramo Suite from Consensys Mesh/DAF team

[Recording](https://us02web.zoom.us/rec/share/a134lNnRootkzsl4EQEWozpIKFNBugdtwR5old__HJr1-AAllgOIrzRwdyLv9APP.hfc2l_l6zl_1EQPj)

Agenda
- introductions and announcements
    - [INATBA Roundtable](https://inatba.org/events-calendar/decentralised-identity-whats-at-stake/) happening tomorrow - come support DIF members Jolocom (Kai) and Transmute (Karyl) that are speaking on a panel with friends of the podcast Daniel du Seuil and Anil John!
- Presentation of Veramo
    - [Website](https://veramo.io) and [github repo](https://github.com/uport-project/veramo)

<details>
<summary>Minutes</summary>

- Intro - uPort history and relationship between Consensys, uPort, and Veramo
    - Veramo URL: http://veramo.io
    - backward compatibility with uPort, but more easily extensible and modular architecture
    - moving to a more messaging- and event-based structure
- Architecture tour - highlevel
    - SDR - temporary presentation request while we wait for a wider standard to harden (will replace later with Pres Manifest or such)
    - W3C Credential (JWT)

![](https://i.imgur.com/J4hJI77.png)

- Architecture tour - Plugins and modules
    - Agent Apps: Veramo CLI & Veramo Agent App (HTTP)
    - modular plugins that expose methods to each other via TypeScript API calls or via openAPI proper 

![](https://i.imgur.com/gy4jTOz.png)
- Roadmap
    - LD Proofs coming soon
    - Presentation Exchange / Cred Manifest
    - Aries & DIDComm v2 (will replace native Veramo messaging)
    - DID:Ion ?
    - Modular enough that other people can write plugins for any ZKP presentations and verifications people want, be our guest!

- Juan's questions
    - Data store (SQL?) versus EDV? Key manager versus KeyCloak or WebKMS?
    - REPLACE messaging with DIDComm? Backwards compat?
    
- Q and A
    - Adrian: This is great, feels like it 
    - Adrian: Is this an attempt to remake GNAP AS for SSI tools? Or is the future API fortresses? 
        - Future agenda item?
        - Oliver: I think the veramo plugin system with remote plugins would work with GNAP, depending how you divide labor between parties in your architecture; I can definitely imagine a plugin method using GNAP to convey privileges between remote plugins on diff exec environments; we see that as in scope;
        - Oliver: I'd be really interested to hear you speak about what GNAP's role would be? It's important, sure, but it's also specific to the architecture you're imagining
        - Sam Curren: This architecture can use its backend service an agent, but that agent isn't an AS, although it can work with one; client/server model is a weird fit to agent-to-agent architectures, so not incompatible; 
        - Sam: Pluggable authZ schemes depend on what role it plays (as agent) 
    - KMS versus other KMSs
        - Key Manager is not to replace, just an interface (webKMS could replace it, if someone made an interface for it; EDVs could replace the data store if someone figures out the custom API)
        - Rouven - could also be used as a testing framework with DID:Key - all you need is a few plugins
    - Pam: This presentation was very complete and professional-- OS, right? How would you sell this to a customer? How do you sell this? I would like to amplify this.
        - Rouven - enterprise plugins & legacy support plugins for hire :), not much 
    - Sam: Pushing messaging problems into resource framework?

<details>
<summary>Minutes</summary>
* Walkthrough of paper (10min)
    * Scene by Scene
    * Scenes that need the most love: 8, 9, 10
* Review
    * Marty Reed: Partic in ed, we talk a lot about human-readable, 
    * Keith: I've had lots of these conversations with decision-makers, but... how do we cut through the complexity to them?
    * Keith: Can we phrase it as betting advice? Are you telling people to bet on one horse? The paper seems a little biased in favor of BBS+ IMHO...
        * Kaliya: We can't pretend these differences don't exist
    * Keith: I felt this paper glossed over the pairwise DID
        * Sidebar on which systems use pairwise (including JWT, ZKP-CL, and LD systems!) and others don't (in all the same categories)-- it's a cross-cutting (transversal?) category
    * Scene 9 BBS+ walkthru (Kyle dH)- issuer signs VC (which has a **signature** on it) and holder signs VP (which has a **proof** on it).
    * Scene 10 - 
    * Kyle: what's diff between ZKP and nonZKP - all nonZKPs have in common not wanting to reveal the DID or the signature-- ZKP lets you withhold both holderDID and holderDID-Signature in VPs
* Warmup discussion: How do you describe the VC format decision to decision-makers, clients, outsiders, etc? (10min)

* Crowd-edit and pile-on (30min)

* Closing discussion: where does this paper go and what else can be done to make this clearer (or obsolete)

### Agenda - 16 Dec 2020 - US/APAC time (1400 PT) - VC deep dive series: A VC-focused Tour of the Authenticator architecture with Tim Capalli (MSFT)

[Recording](https://us02web.zoom.us/rec/share/UhIV-vk98lnyeVLaHuGq_o_f8NiuQ2uKA3GM1vMtcg6z8T04y9ugnS6vRzbZkuYe.gy0oWuxjwibGyfXM)

<summary>Notes</summary>
Intros
- Eric Kuhn (MSFT Id team)
- Tim Capalli (MSFT since March)

Intro
- Authenticator now contains: PW manager and cred wallet, OTP handler, etc
- screenshare and PPT slides (not yet live demo)
- swimlane
- Q&A
    * Nader: other did method roadmap?
    * Eric Kuhn: ION and only passive support for others for now (internal univ resolv)
    * Eric: Pres Exch asks for type by descriptor_map.id
    * Pam: Name all the specs? DID SIOP, VC and DID-core, PresExch, .well-known (being tested today); verification algo and curve? Secp256k1 for now; Wallet only holds JWT (secp);but Authenticator also verifies LD (ED25519)
    * Adrian: Wha't's SIOP adding here? Tim: If you were using a passport or authZ library, it usually has OIDC; this lets you drop SIOP in; Pam: If you're already supporting centralized stuff, this allows you to support VCs
    * Adrian: Consent roadmapped for later? Would you offer an open API, so that those of us that live in the intricate-consent landscape, would be able to use a plugin for more complex consent?
        - Tim: we were thinking more configuration API for setting defaults...
        - Adrian: Azure is all about a massive Configuration JSON object; the longterm goal is for VCs to course along pathways that have ; Eric: Not using CM yet (custom contract for now); once we move to CM, the inputs to the card would be mapped to available info; Adrian: I'm more con
        - Adrian: Should we build a catalog of customizations that can happen in each wallet? Linked secrets or pairwise a required feature of interop? 
            * Tim: Pairwise by default -- should we ever allow op-in?
            * Eric: Authenticator knows to call an API to get a new VC for each new RP
        - Adrian: if we're not going to phone home and we're going to make pairwise the default, how do we break the glass in case of emergencies? Can a court order de-anonymize or trace back a pairwise?
            * Kaliya: Old-school LD VCs, without ZKP, weren't as concerned with total anonymity...
            * Nader: Hey Adrian, the answer to your question of how does blinded subject authentication work in the context of JSON-LD BBS+ is explained in this slide, starting on slide 12

[Recording](https://us02web.zoom.us/rec/share/YJSiutQrX4VvI-H9_JZmaXP5tyd7DtqOqoHkTIXIuofCNhb2IFekEZ2K4FHqNco.FvPxN0QFxhlp2mYG)

* more detailed tour of functional architecture for both projects
* Daniel Du Seuil - A high-level overview of the ESSIF project 
    * Timeline of specifications for different aspects of the project
    * Interop specifications discussion-- how to align with existing API standards?
* Oskar van Deventer - An interop-focused (and open-call-detailed!) status update from the ESSIF-LAB incubator - [SLIDES HERE](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/interoperability/raw/master/assets/guest-slides/20201209-van-Deventer%2C-Oskar__ESSIF-LAB%2BDIF-Interop.pdf)
    * Oskar: how we think about linking it up to ToIP (as an ecosystem, regarding governance, and terminology) - Is Dutch SSI ecosystem or eSSIF-Lab an “ecosystem”? Could eSSIF-Lab hand off their work as input documents to the Ecosystem Foundry?
    * Interop specifications discussion-- how to align with existing API standards?
* Open Q&A

    * Adrian Gropper ([HIE of One](https://hieofone.com/)): Working on Privacy things. 
    * Dr. Susanne Guth-Oriowski, Chief Innovation & Solution Officer of [Spherity](https://www.spherity.com). 

* Daniel: ESSIF
    * Slides
    * *cough cough* millions of euros budgets for contracts for improvements on core services and infra
    * question what kind of ledger - some will be public permissioned. Hyperledger Bezu and Fabric are in use now. We will see other use-cases. EU looking at precommerical procurement and new protocols avaliable. 
    * Question what should the standards groups be doing to be helpful? What we currently do we don't have an official representation in those groups, we might do so going forward. They are active in different working groups (ISO mentioned)public sector we are very affraid to build someting non-standard. We support all these kinds of things we need to be interoperable. It is public sector and needs to serve everyone. A lot of things are being still being evolved, discussed, it is evolving very fast, what are the things that are stable. Next year will be an important year. Are they compatable with emerging systems. EBSI will be interacting transcontinental working with Canada and Australia - there the standards will be more involved. 
     * Question within ESSIF differnet frameworks and use - interoperability provided by the data registries on top. See GATCA doing some good work. EBSI won't be imposing the way we do it on other sectors. 
     * Markus suggest that we could add the ESIF resolver to the universal resolver .Agreed yes.

* Presentation by Oskar 
    * We are using the metaphor of form filling. 
    * We have a bunch of open calls. Business Open calls. 
    * HOw everything works together for interoperability.
    * They are having various companies open sourcing wallet solution (including evernym) In the first business oriented open call  - GATACA they are working on a generic verifier solution. They can use multiple SSI technologies. Generic SSI functionality offered on a commercial Basis. Open in March closes in May. Active in Area of deploma's Main requirements use SSI components. Everything tightly connected together. Scalabe interoperable. Here are a bunch of examples of things we are looking for. Counter measures vs. SSI coersion. It will be very easy to ask for access to your credentials. Looking for technical, legal business solution. Also looking at integration of different types of SSI tech - INdy/Aries is differet then ESIF. Surprise us! things that will be useful for SSI ecosystem. Third and may part - DIF interoperability working group - the whole purpose - we have these innovators building components and work together. Want thriving business SSI ecosystem. ESSIF lab providing funding and support for the commercial SSI implementations. Should work together components being developed within ESSIF-Lab we have some interop project - shouldn't that type of work happening in a broader arena such as DIF interop. Multiple groups ask to join - ESSIF party is small - DIF innterop is bigger. Once we develop these interoperabilty profiles we get to standardization. This is the architecture picture we are using. You probably recognized - focus on higher layers. 
    * Picture shows a universal agent - issuer holder and verifier functionality. We don't like about many wallet solutions they are holder oriented - client-server. When it should be semetrical - if two parties do interactions they want to do mutual verification - (parties going to a website needing to know it is really that company) 
    * Qualified data. 
    * Work in progress - is this picture something we should contribute to DIF/ToIP?  We have lots of sub-grantees. LInks show where to find
    * [DIF member] Evernym is open sourcing their verify.me platform.
    * DIF member] Validated=ID in EBSI/ESSIF will be driving interoperability with the eIDAS-Bridge.
    * Slide: List of busines oriented interope they are all over the map. 
        * How to manage so much...How make something complex like this with 50-60 subgranties - and make it work? 
    * Here is the DIF slide. 
        * We are doing a lot - there is an interoperability effort. 
        * Ecosystem foundry is at ToIP. WE don't have a standing organization and continuity - we want that. 
         * **We don't have a method for interoperability and home for code**. To find what of this work can be done in
* Questions: would you consider having a home in one of the organizations in the ecosystem. 
     
* Question asked about JSON-LD ZKP BBS+ - Daniel its far ahead of where the governments are.

* Introduction to [Spec Map](https://github.com/manicprogrammer/vc-spec-rel/) with researcher Michael Ruminer, talking about how to maintain it going forward
* BBS+ in Aries overview with Stephen Curran

<details>
<summary>Notes</summary>

* Michael Ruminer
    * Self-education motivation - testing the hypothesis that with the right overview, the VC universe can be grokkable
    * Release page on github repo (already in DIF repo!)
        * plug for .drawio - open-source diagramming tool
    * quick tour of the diagram
        * white boxes - external to decentralized identity community
        * CCG-centric by formation, but looking forward to add more DIF and Hyperledger RFCs
            * Left out SIOP to make it to v1, hehe 
    * Q & A 
        * Adrian: DIDs out of scope? 
            * I didn't 
        * Pamela: What did you miss the most going through this? What would've made your life easier?
            * W3C specs all had pretty good normative and informative sections - the ones that didn't took longer and I deferred some of those
        * Juan: What's next?
            * I drew it from bottom to top, so there's more gaps (intentional and accidental) near the top
        * Adrian: VCs presumed to go to holder in too many of these maps; 
        * Stephan: Kumu? Kaliya and I recommend it, it turns CSVs and excel spreadsheets into navigable graphs
            * it's XML underneath, so I'll have to play with Kumu and see how to best port it in!
        * Pamela: How useful were [our] intro videos? Michael: I just read spec by spec; I'll look at videos more when I add DIF specs!
* Stephen's presentation - Aries Great Transformation
    * Moving Indy's role to "DIDs only"; moving VC to BBS+ to keep all the ZKP features but also comply fully with VC spec
    * First-Step - full support for w3c LD-VCs (but no ZKP or revocation)
        * SICPA's --> LD-proof/sig support in Acapy (manual sign/verify, not using Aries libraries) - W3C compliant but no ZKP
        * AriesGo supports RFC 36/37 (or 453/454) - rebuilding for other agent framework in Py and .NET
        * Credential storage in Aries "Askar"? Searchable/discoverable proof request?
            * Indy has "wallet query language" which search against proof request; how to replace?
    * Second-Step - finish BBS+ enough to spec out and roadmap Aries work in multiple languages
    * Third Step - Presentation Exhange 
        * DIF's Pres Exch versus SVIP version (not yet thoroughly reviewed against featureset of Indy wallet req and/or BBS+)
            * DIF Pres Exch (allows multiple credentials into one VP, which helps BBS+ proof/verify style)
    * Other topics
        * Storage searching for credentials 
        * Support in wallets and other mobile apps
        * Can anoncreds and BBS+ be supported at same time? backwards compatibility and cross-verification?
    * Q & A
        * Pam: Discovery in the wallet not currently in-scope for PE-- would you put it in scope if you could?
            * Stephen: I don't mind it being out of scope, because that gets into wallet/storage design 
            * Stephen: Early days of Indy, searching was important in OrgBook's 7million VCs-- 
    * DID-Only Indy
        * Draft DID:Indy [spec](https://hackmd.io/@icZC4epNSnqBbYE0hJYseA/S1eUS2BQw) puts non-DID objects(schema, revocation registries, etc) into did docs and refers to them as URIs ; (BBS+ don't need the schema and credDef anyways); RevReg will stay on-ledger
        * Adrian: having trouble reconciling DIDs, BBS+, and confidential storage - it seems to me that adding stuff to the DID-core might be a bad idea? I like DIDs as control structures only :D; why not lean on some of the stuff being pushed in the confidential storage group ? Might the three (DID control structure, storage, and selective disclosure) be orthogonal by design?
            * Stephen: Using DID as indirection layer makes cross-ledger interactions much simpler and

#### LD/BBS+ Education: Walkthroughs and Mental Models/Reports from the Field

Tobias - "BBS+ 201"
- Tobias will be overviewing and answering questions about his IIW [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVnCVzW0rkI)
- Additional recommended reading:
    - Tobias' colleague [Nader Helmy](https://medium.com/mattr-global/jwt-vs-linked-data-proofs-comparing-vc-assertion-formats-a2a4e6671d57): is BBS+ really a "credential format" or is it a combination of credential handling and presenting methods? Is it a security model? Does the "credential format" mental model underestimate or misframe the kinds of changes needed to fully "go BBS+"?
    - The [paper](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot9-prague/blob/master/final-documents/alice-attempts-abuse-verifiable-credential.md) on Sybil-proofing VC exchange referenced at minute 18.30 of Tobias' video from RWoT9, by WG co-chair Pam Dingle, Daniel Hardman, researcher Sven Hammon, et al.
- Discussion questions
    1. To what degree is this a VC "format", and to what degree is it a VP upgrade?
    1. What standards need to change/upgrade for these additional values ("proofValue", "subjectAuthenticationMethod", etc.) to be widespread? Consequences for core VC spec, LD-Proof spec, etc?
    1. How are domains and linked secrets related, in the Aries universe? Are systems outside of the Aries world using domain-based indirection?
    1. How big is the "lift" (or level of effort) for Aries systems post-[RFC 47](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0047-json-ld-compatibility/README.md)?  How big for non-Aries systems already using LD-VCs today?  How big for JWT-native systems? 
    1. [If time allows] Could we talk more about "Just-in-time Issuance" and "Trusted Witness" solutions?

#### LD/BBS+ Education Pt. 1: Walkthroughs and Mental Models/Reports from the Field
- Guest Presenter #1: Orie Steele- [The What and Why of the DIF general-purpose Document-Loader](https://youtu.be/-yUbMDft5O0)
- Guest Presenter #2: Kim H Duffy - [W3C-CCG Edu Creds Task Force & Tooling/Sandbox Intro](https://youtu.be/AEb02JGCArM) (Overview of CCG LD tooling)

Minutes 
* Opening discussion
* Document-Loader introduction by Orie (Transmute)
    * Intro: What do DIDs and VCs do, ideally?
        * Definitions: "resolution" (in DID-core) and "representations" (LD versus vanilla-JSON versus...)
        * DID Doc versus OIDC federation of centralized IDs
        * Resolution mechanics vary significantly by representation; most methods have one "native" rep that skews its resolution mental model
        * In LD-land, document-loader is the norm (essential to all LD-centric methods' resolution mechanisms)
    * Document-Loader as recursive/general-purpose derefencer
        * JSON-LD core spec models/specs this
    * Sidebar q: novice-friendlier explanation of representations-- does it matter to privacy people? to security people?
        * Orie: Each representation is governed by a spec (JSON RFCs, for ex); it has limitations, allowances, features, assumptions, more or less built-in data types; 
        * DID-Core takes LD dereferencing and extends it to a whole identifier system; extending it to vanilla JSON, XML, CBOR, etc gets complicated and implies "LD problems," i.e. how to do resolution and resolving
        * [Mental note: return to Adrian's question about security and privacy issues inherent in resolution/dereferencing]
    * Document-loading - a particular way of resolving data; DID-core has its origins in this kind of resolution
        * many interoperability problems at the PKI layer and at the assertion-format layer arise from "gaps" between representations or between specs written with different assumptions in mind
        * codifying did-core dereferencing logic (going from string --> did doc) got written by uPort team and has been foundational for many non-LD systems; JWT proof formats similarly had to be built by equivalence;
        * more general d-l logic:
            * did resolution: string --> doc
            * schema.org
            * Azure IoT and other contexts that identify entities with strings --> also D-L 
* Kim: Overview of [VC-Edu group](w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-ed) at CCG
    * Major work items:
        * Modeling Ed Creds - usecase driven (ins and outs, design principles, lessons learned)
        * Credential Finder - LD-powered discovery engine
    * Not an SDO, but wide participation and experience: PESC IMS-Global and other international bodies (mostly EU)
        * "unblock and accelerate our pilots"
        * legal signature requirements (CAs, x509, regional/national specifics about eSigs)
        * XML and PDFs = 
    * DCC Credential [Playground](digitalcredentials.github.io/playground) - sandbox for LD VCs and 
        * /sign-and-verify/ tools = 
        * /credgen/ = template tool (generates LD VC templates using {{moustached pattern-matching}})
    * Other useful links
        * Mattr's BBS+ LD proofs [spec](https://github.com/w3c-ccg/ldp-bbs2020)
        * LD VCs standardized on LD-centric CCG [exch protocol](https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-http-api)
    * Q&A
        * Keith (Workday) - We're working on a pilot - is anyone else using the LER wrapper?
            * Kim: Interop test suites (orig. SVIP, now CCG) - conformance test suites 
        * Pam: What would you like this group to do?
            * Kim: context: ACE blockchain challenge and wallets; DIF would be a good location for practical ongoing discussion of logistics for those kinds of venues
* Future agenda topic - Power in the standards process - separation of concerns as a mantra for protecting against coupling of ontology and platform mechanics?

 | Test Suite Jamboree | Apples-to-apples comparison of available test suites and how we could leverage them here | If possible: matrix showing equivalent suite results across stacks |
 | Pres-Exch/Aries alignment| The DIF Presentation Exchange spec has flows and assumptions that are hard to reconcile with Aries flows and assumptions. | 1. minor pull requests against both specs 2. implementation guidance that would make Aries wallets easier to comply with Pres Exch and vice versa. 3. a great deep-dive blog post for the DIF Medium :D | 
 | Wallet Method Support |Wallet can resolve a DID *and* know how to verify the VCs it can sign? | * Matrix of methods per Wallet for generated and resolved DIDs * DID Resolution implementation guidelines for wallet designers/implementers?

    * IIW31 earlybird tickets end today!
    * Shout-out to Adrian's thread on the [mailinglist](https://dif.groups.io/g/interop-wg/topics) about human-centric interop and the UX work-- we promise we'll get back to this!  It's deferred (see "future topics" at top of this running agenda), but it's definitely not tabled. See also https://github.com/w3c/did-use-cases/issues/101
        * In the meantime, interested parties are welcome to join the DIF Product Managers' **non-IPR-protected** [community of practice](https://dif.groups.io/g/id-productmanagers), which is currently in a multi-week discussion of human-centric UX thinking around SSI onboarding processes.
    * Thread on DECO project out of Cornell on [CCG](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2020Sep/0005.html) - may be worth addressing or socializing in this group if there is interest/demand
    * Deputize queue-masters from the back seat: see something, say something!
1. Refactor mapping exercise into layers
    * optional homework: leave comments on the [whimsical](https://whimsical.com/VVRMbTi9bPsCqagmRVNGvm), or fork it and make your own variants to compare/contrast next week or OOB? Whimsical instructions [here](https://www.notion.so/dif/Procedural-Notes-github-etc-d31f543e8a94441ebeb1550e671ff195)
    * [Martin and Nader might present variants?]

Minutes:

   * Brett McDowell - Hedera Hashgraph
   * Taylor Kendal - Learning Economy Fndn
* Mapping Exercise  
    * Pam Dingle talking about the slices of the stack and naming 
    * there are exchange of verifiable credentials as one main use case and decentralized Applications "DApps" as another one and asking people to think about how this set of use-cases
    * From chat:
        * Brent would like Hedera's [method listed too](https://www.hedera.com/blog/hedera-hashgraph-joins-world-wide-web-consortium-w3c-new-did-method-published-by-w3c-credentials-community-group#:~:text=The%20Hedera%20DID%20Method%20leverages,to%20the%20Decentralized%20Identity%20model).
        * Orie suggested that the The algorithm bucket is lacking… better to link to
            * https://www.iana.org/assignments/jose/jose.xhtml#web-signature-encryption-algorithms
            * https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-cryptosuite-registry/ 
        * DIDComm = SOAP 2.0: I like soap, its a message format, that is transport agnostic, and supports routing, and other sub specs :) … sorta like did comm… but sadly soap is xml  focused…. didcomm is currently JSON + DID focused… did comm does a not of stuff, but its mostly about a message format that works with dids.
        * that's a pretty good summary.
        * Im sorry I know being compared to soap is triggering… but FWIW, I loved Visual Basic and SOAP and WSDL… some of the first coding I ever did. 
        * AuthN is very different from AuthZ.  But then again, I'm not sure what the goal of this inventory is.  Do we need to differentiate them?  What's the end game here?
        * Tom: D So if you look at this from the perspective of a resource server serving up health data about a patient, you can use did auth to prove the identity of an entity seeking patient data.  You use SIOP to communicate the fact that there’s a valid credential that AUTHORIZES that entity to access  the particular patient data, as example. 
        * Orie: Authorizations mostly go in the http header… mostly… 
        * Brett: After you are authenticated (AuthN), then you get authorized to access certain resources (AuthZ)
        *  Sam: not necessarily with OCAP ZCAP. you can have AuthZ with those, but no authentication. 
        *  Orie: Yep, capabilities sole existence is to avoid authN… https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confused_deputy_problem

<details>
<summary>Minutes</summary>
   * Self-Introductions
       * Martin Riedel (ConsenSys R&D Eng)
       * Denis Popov (Affinity, Eng Team) - here for same!
       * Stas Demchuk (Affinity, Eng Lead) - looking forward to scaling globally with the help of this group
    * Pam: could the questionnaire be a MadLibs-style fill-in-the-blank paragraph? 
        * Juan: Rename DID-Doc Storage? because DID-Docs are one-time/ephemeral, what's being stored is Resolution Metadata/data
        * Martin: layering might be a little easier to understand if it were protocol and app layer rather than DID and VC; **PRIMITIVES** off to one side (libraries or tools that appear throughout)
        * Adrian: Layers metaphor inherited from narrow waist (TCP/IP) theory and classic internet standards (link to KERI slide?); is narrow waist pertinent? worth keeping in mind?
            * KERI slide [deck](https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/presentations/KERI2_Overview.web.pdf) slides 8-13ish
            * Juan: Debate as to which layer/bucket is the narrowest waist
            * Adrian: But if we knew that, we'd have a universal/shared understanding/definition of interop and big picture! 
        * Adrian: My opinion is that any waist is a human-readable/market-legible badge of standards-driven interoperability ; I call it a "gold button" to hide the DID/handshake nittygritty
            * Kaliya: let's not conflate technical and human-readable answers to the question!
        * Pamela: Are DIDs themselves one waist or interoperable layer?
            * Adrian: Authentication and Authorization functions of DIDs are a waist
        * Pam: I think VCs are a second waist/neck/whatever; We need a trust layer to perform trusted/verifiable operations, or else no one care about DIDs
            * Rouven: Standardization of a payload; Timothy Ruff's "container" [article](https://medium.com/@rufftimo/verifiable-credentials-arent-credentials-they-re-containers-fab5b3ae5c0) comes to mind
        * Adrian: I think we are quite far away from standardization at the DID layer-- Joe Andreiu, Sam Smith, and other core people are still debating VERY fundamental stuff at this late date in the [DID-core group](https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/)...
        * Rouven: Goals might be a helpful orthogonal or supplemental question: what usecases or features make all this worthwhile? What is the payoff motivating choices within buckets.
        * Scott Malley: Devil's advocate-- doesn't "why" risk going out of scope? Taken far enough, this is not an interop question (e.g. advising on choice of DID Methods, assessing did methods according to the rubric)

    4. Parking Lot
        *  Adrian: Have we failed if normal people have to know what a DID is?
        *  Rouven: What motivates design choices? Can these be linked to tradeoffs or decisions WITHIN this map? 
            *  **Maybe the madlib/questionnaire should have a `BECAUSE...` entry for each other entry?**
        *  Adrian: I'm bored, can we spend the same amount of time on a human-centric mapping? [**proposed work item**]

### Agenda - 19 Aug 2020 - morning time (0600 PST)

Self-Introductions and Announcements (5min)  
* Stephen Curran - BCGov is looking for help with headless mobile testing! Anyone with experience and tool recommendations/suggestions please reach out!


#### Agenda.md / hackmd tour (10min)s
#### Documentation.md tour (5min)

<details> 
<summary> Orie - tour of explainer.md and other work to date/ongoing inheritance (30min - got lively)
</summary>

* Sam Curren: tests can be gamed and used as a hammer if they're imposed unilaterally
* Orie: gathering consensus and designing goals in a way that insures wide contribution
* Adrian: Registry as design tool for tests and projects: align workflow with the level of effort and format of the WG-- signup, link to other work, etc (//DID:Method [registry](https://w3c.github.io/did-spec-registries/#did-methods)?)
* Sankarshan: is there a vision that tests are going to be **continuous** as a design principle or more used as a test **battery** versioned to be run against specific components and stacks? In other words, how are inter-op breakage and failures flagged.
* Rouven: Broader definition of interoperability -- analogy to something as specific as Aries test harness breaks down because there aren't specs equivalent to the Aries RFCs that (in the best of cases) define test vectors precisely?
* Rouven + Orie: tests connected to specs > tests defined by broader, less technically-defined goals; DID-WG working on conformance tests that... work better than the prior ones (which SVIP had to rework to be more test-able)
* Sam: 2 camps of testing thought in Aries community - regression tests against user behavior (community-maintained testing scripts); telecom-style swap-testing (component-testing) - complementary, not competing approaches (either in isolation carries risks: maintenance, first-mover advantage, etc)
* Pam: Tooling in Aries? Sam: A little bifurcated along the above-mentioned lines; Stephan: major maintenance backlog/debt! Sam: One major contributor in each camp
* Kaliya: Sorry, which camp is which? Stephen: The BCGov harness is broader and includes unit tests (98.6% coverage!); the HL one comes more from the telco style of rack-testined. 
* Orie: but both are integration tests looking at inputs/outputs of each piece of software as a black box (agents under test) against RFCs that outline testable conditions and normative behaviors.  This is great!
* Orie: Harness approach // smoketest in CI/CD terms; 
* Stephen: Headless mobile testing expertise warmly requested for ongoing work in the Aries test harness!
